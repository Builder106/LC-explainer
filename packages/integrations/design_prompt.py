DESIGN_PROMPT = """
You are an expert UI/UX designer specializing in educational tools and video thumbnails for coding tutorials. Your task is to generate detailed design specifications for two components in a code-driven LeetCode explainer video framework:

1. **Thumbnails**: For YouTube video previews (1280x720 PNG).
2. **Pseudo-LeetCode Interface**: A simulated LeetCode UI for faceless video demonstrations.

**Project Context**:
- **Audience**: Beginner to intermediate programmers learning LeetCode patterns (e.g., hash maps, two pointers).
- **Format**: Faceless, 6-9 minute videos generated programmatically (no human recording).
- **Style**: Educational, professional, code-focused; avoid flashy elements.
- **Constraints**: Flat design only (solid colors, no gradients, no AI-generated images); use simple typography and minimalist icons; ensure consistency for branding.
- **Tools**: Designs must be implementable in Python (e.g., Pillow for thumbnails, custom scenes for interface).
- **Integration**: Thumbnails from episode metadata; interface simulates problem-solving with UMPIRE method (Understand, Match, Plan, Implement, Review, Evaluate).

**Design Requirements**:
- **Thumbnails**:
  - Flat design: Solid background color (e.g., dark blue #1a1a1a), bold white text.
  - Elements: Title (large, centered), difficulty badge (colored circle), pattern icon (simple SVG), no gradients.
  - Readability: High contrast, sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto).
  - Consistency: Uniform layout across episodes.
- **Pseudo-Interface**:
  - Simulate LeetCode UI: Problem description panel, code editor (with syntax highlighting), console output.
  - UMPIRE Integration: Sections for each phase with animations (e.g., text reveals, code typing).
  - Flat Design: Solid colors, clean lines, no shadows or gradients.
  - Functionality: Clickable elements (simulated), responsive layout.

Generate creative yet practical designs that enhance learning and maintain professionalism.
