## Production Pipeline

### Steps
1. Backlog/ideation (tag by pattern/difficulty/runtime)
2. Objectives + recognition cues (one-sentence learning goal)
3. Script and storyboard (timed beats)
4. Asset prep (code snippets, diagrams, overlays, captions)
5. TTS render (voice selection, segments)
6. Timeline assembly (scenes align to TTS beats)
7. Edit polish (template-driven, zooms, lower-thirds)
8. QA (accuracy, captions, color/contrast, accessibility)
9. Publish (title, description, chapters, thumbnail)
10. Feedback loop (analytics → backlog updates)

### Episode template
- 00:00 Hook; what, why, where applied
- Restate problem; constraints; examples
- Baseline → intuition → pattern choice
- Walkthrough with highlights/diffs
- Complexity; trade-offs; alt approach
- Gotchas; rule of thumb; practice
- Deep link CTA
