## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Complex animations (e.g., large DP tables) may cause slow renders or crashes.
  - **Mitigation**: Profile renders early; optimize library with caching; set hardware requirements (e.g., 8GB RAM).
  - **Owner**: Developer; Track in Phase 2.5.
- **Dependency Issues**: FFmpeg/Python library conflicts or updates breaking compatibility.
  - **Mitigation**: Pin versions in requirements.txt; run CI tests on multiple OS; monitor for updates.
  - **Owner**: Developer; Address in ongoing maintenance.
- **TTS Accuracy**: Mispronunciations or timing errors in narration.
  - **Mitigation**: Use fallback TTS providers; manual QA on scripts; integrate Gemini for script review.
  - **Owner**: Content Creator; Test in Phase 1.4.

### Content Risks
- **LeetCode Changes**: Updates to problem slugs or UI affecting deep links.
  - **Mitigation**: Use slug-based links; monitor LeetCode; have backup examples.
  - **Owner**: Content Creator; Review quarterly.
- **Intellectual Property**: Copyright issues with code snippets or diagrams.
  - **Mitigation**: Use fair use guidelines; attribute sources; create original visuals.
  - **Owner**: Developer; Legal review before launch.

### Operational Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Adding too many patterns early.
  - **Mitigation**: Stick to single-pattern episodes; use backlog tags; time-box scripting.
  - **Owner**: All; Enforce in planning meetings.
- **Burnout**: Time-intensive animation/scripting.
  - **Mitigation**: Set weekly limits; automate where possible (e.g., Gemini-assisted drafting).
  - **Owner**: Developer; Monitor in self-reviews.

### External Risks
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Failure to meet WCAG standards.
  - **Mitigation**: Run automated checks; test with screen readers; include captions.
  - **Owner**: Developer; Validate in Phase 1.5.
- **User Feedback Delays**: Slow iteration on video quality.
  - **Mitigation**: Set up feedback channels (e.g., YouTube comments); A/B test thumbnails.
  - **Owner**: Content Creator; Implement in Phase 3.4.

### Monitoring and Review
- Review risks quarterly or after major milestones.
- Escalate high-impact risks (e.g., >50% delay) to adjust TODO.md.
