## Branding and Style

### Visuals
- High-contrast theme; color-safe palette
- Consistent typography; minimal on-screen text
- Reusable lower-thirds, titles, end cards

### Audio
- Clean TTS voice; normalized loudness; gentle BGM with ducking

### Tone
- Direct, friendly, no fluff; 140–160 wpm; 2–4s per on-screen idea
